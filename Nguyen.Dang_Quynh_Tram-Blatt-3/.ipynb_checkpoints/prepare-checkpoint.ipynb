    "what we need for the activate function is the weight and bias. For example: weight *w* = [0,1] (performed in vector form). bias *b* = 4\n",

    "we have database to train. there are some attributes in database. we use some as inputs and produce with *Neuron* a prediction for another attribute (? not sure about the information)\n",
